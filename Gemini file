Changes:
 * Input Parameters: Added inputs for lookback (to control the period for S/R calculation) and other parameters for flexibility.
 * S/R Calculation:
   * ta.highest(high, lookback) finds the highest high in the lookback period.
   * ta.lowest(low, lookback) finds the lowest low in the lookback period.
 * Plotting S/R:  Used plot with trackprice=true to plot horizontal lines for support and resistance levels that adjust dynamically.
Important Notes:
 * Simplified S/R: This script uses a basic method to identify support and resistance. More sophisticated methods might consider factors like volume, price action patterns, and trendlines.
 * Dynamic S/R: The support and resistance levels are dynamic and will change as new highs and lows are formed.
 * Parameter Tuning: Adjust the lookback parameter to fine-tune the sensitivity of the S/R levels.
This enhanced script now incorporates support and resistance levels into the analysis, providing a more comprehensive view of potential trading opportunities. Remember to use it responsibly and combine it with other analysis techniques for better decision-making.
